    summary: |
        Welcome to my page! My name is Luwei Zeng, a student in Project Management 
        in Northwestern University. I am insterested in operation research and 
        transportation. I am currently working with Professor Chen on a project relates to
        freight characteristics, this is a part of a five years big project, and the final 
        goal is to achieve automatic freight operation. 
        I would be finishing my MS degree on about 20th December 2018.

experiences:
    - role: Freight Operation Characteristics
      time: 2018 - Present
      company: Python, R, Tableau (Northwestern University)
      details: |
      
          - Advisor: Professor Ying Chen
          - Objective: Analysis freight operation characteristics to produce a network for 
          evaluation of adaptability of automatics freight.
          - Used real fleet data to analyses freight operation characteristics.
          - Processed raw freight data, used processed data to produce. 
          trajectory-based diagram and network fundamental diagram (NFD).
          - Projected 2D views of freight network on Googel map in different cities.      

    - role: Unconventional Intersection Design & Optimization
      time: 2018 - Present
      company: Python, Vissim (Northwestern University)
      details: |

          - Objective: Propose a two-stage model for the optimal design of 
          displaced left-turn (DLT) intersections.
          - Understood intersections design with multifarious constraints.
          - Calculated optimal lane length and signal control (cycle length).
          - Built simulation models and experiments in Vissim 9.0 with difference settings.
          - Compared the performance of continuous flow intersection (CFI) 
          and parallel flow intersection (PFI).
          - Conclusion: CFI performed better than conventional intersection, 
          also had a wider range of applications.

          - Used android App to acquire real-time traffic data, inducing GPS 
          coordination data,speed of the buses,energy efficiency and other indicators.
          - Compared real Macau driving cycle with Japan modes, and 
          simulated data with Matlab and evaluated the performance.
          - Summarized the comparison of different type of buses in the final paper.
          - Conclusion: the usage of electrical bus in Macau is on a feasible level.
         
    - role: The Measurement of Low Pressures in Wind Tunnels
      time: 2013 - 20114      
      company: Ecxcel, sensor software (Durham University)
      details: |

          - Advisor: Dr. Robert Dominy
          - Objective: test the reliability of unconventional pressure 
          sensor, which allow actual air flow pass through it.
          - Created different pressure environment with centrifugal fan and wind tunnel.
          - Designed various type of innovative connecting tube restrictions for testing.
          - Compared the measurement with reference values.
          - Evaluated the data collected and summary the performance of the sensor.
          - Conclusion: sensors are reliable working with tubing which has inner 
          diameter 5mm and less than 1 meter long. The diameter of restriction
          and tubing are import factors for sensor accuracy, but the length of 
          restriction and tubing are not.
